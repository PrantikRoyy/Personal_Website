                <h3>To Do List</h3>
                Description: This program allows the user to create a "To Do List" which allows the user to add/delete tasks. These application 
                allows the user to save tasks on the computer to see even after terminating the program and the tasks can be marked 
                as completed or uncompleted.

                <h3>Online Diary</h3>
                Description: This program is a website that allows users to make their own password-protected online diary where diaries can be 
                shown publicly with the author's permission but the diaries can only be edited by the author. A casual user can click 
                on any of the diaries to go to a new tab where all the visible links to the entries of that diary can be shown in order. 
                If an entry link is clicked, the user goes to a new tab where the entry is shown along with a next/prev option at the 
                top to go to different entries like flipping pages in a diary. Each entry will have its own topics with text and name. 
                The general idea is to have a password and username input at the bottom to access one’s personal diary as the author to 
                edit all their diaries in a separate tab. Once the user logs in to their diary as an author, they gain the option to 
                make/delete new entries or make them visible. Once the user clicks on an entry they will go to a book view where the entries 
                of the diary will be shown in “pages” that can be “flipped”. Said entries will have topics that come in the form of a box 
                with a section for text and another section for images that will get displayed along with the text. A user can have the option 
                to make/delte as many topics as they want with each topics having a visibility option in the form that makes the entry visible
                or non-visible publicly. Once the users are done editing the topic. (Note: Due to the difficulty in implementing a server for 
                this website, the information inputted to the dairies and their entries and topics will not be saved and the visibility option 
                will be left non-functional since all the information is reset as soon as one of the website pages is closed.) Once they are done 
                editing all the entries, the user can press a logout button at the top right to log out of author view and go back to the normal 
                public view.
